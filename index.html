		<h2> What is soccer? </h2>
		<p> Soccer is a sport that was created more than 150 years ago in England. It consists of two teams of 11 players each which play trying to score a goal in a net sustained by three posts (this is called the goal). The team that scores the most amount of goals in 90 minutes wins. </p>
